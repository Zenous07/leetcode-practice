682. Baseball Game
Solved
Easy

You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules.
At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith
operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

1. An integer x  
   - Record a new score of x.

2. "+"  
   - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.

3. "D"  
   - Record a new score that is double the previous score.

4. "C"  
   - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all operations.

All operations are guaranteed to be valid, and the result fits in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:

Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30

Explanation:
"5" -> record = [5]
"2" -> record = [5, 2]
"C" -> record = [5]
"D" -> record = [5, 10]
"+" -> record = [5, 10, 15]
Sum = 30

Example 2:

Input: ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
Output: 27

---

Example 3:

Input: ops = ["1","C"]
Output: 0

---

Constraints:

1 <= operations.length <= 1000  
operations[i] is "C", "D", "+", or an integer in the range [-3 * 10^4, 3 * 10^4]  
"+" always has at least two previous scores  
"C" and "D" always have at least one previous score
