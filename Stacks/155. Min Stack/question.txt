155. Min Stack
Solved
Medium

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element
in constant time.

Implement the MinStack class:

- MinStack() initializes the stack object.
- push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
- pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
- top() gets the top element of the stack.
- getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

Each operation must run in O(1) time complexity.

Example 1:

Input:
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output:
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation:
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // returns -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // returns 0
minStack.getMin(); // returns -2

---

Constraints:

-2^31 <= val <= 2^31 - 1  
Methods pop, top, and getMin will always be called on non-empty stacks  
At most 3 * 10^4 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and getMin
