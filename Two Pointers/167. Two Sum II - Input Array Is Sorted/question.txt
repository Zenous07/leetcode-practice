167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

Difficulty: Medium

Problem Statement:
You are given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
Find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where:
1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length

Return the indices of the two numbers as an integer array [index1, index2].
You may not use the same element twice.

The solution must use only constant extra space.
The problem guarantees exactly one solution.

Example 1:
Input: numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation:
2 + 7 = 9, so index1 = 1 and index2 = 2.

---

Example 2:
Input: numbers = [2, 3, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 3]
Explanation:
2 + 4 = 6, so index1 = 1 and index2 = 3.

---

Example 3:
Input: numbers = [-1, 0], target = -1
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation:
-1 + 0 = -1, so index1 = 1 and index2 = 2.

---

Constraints:
2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4
-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order
-1000 <= target <= 1000
Exactly one solution exists
