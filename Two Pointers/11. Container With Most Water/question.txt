11. Container With Most Water

Difficulty: Medium

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array height of length n.
There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
You may not slant the container.

Example 1:
Input: height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
Output: 49
Explanation:
The maximum area is formed between lines at indices 1 and 8.
Area = min(8, 7) * (8 - 1) = 49.

Example 2:
Input: height = [1, 1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
2 <= height.length <= 10^5
0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
