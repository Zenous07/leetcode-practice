PROBLEM NAME: 344. Reverse String
DIFFICULTY: Easy

================================================================

--- PROBLEM DESCRIPTION ---
The task is to write a function that reverses a given string, which is provided as an array of characters 's'. 

The key requirement is that the modification must be done "in-place." This means you are not allowed to allocate extra space for another array; you must rearrange the elements within the existing array provided in the input.

--- CONSTRAINTS & GOALS ---
* Goal: Reverse the character array such that the first element becomes the last, the second becomes the second-to-last, and so on.
* Memory Constraint: Must use $O(1)$ extra memory.
* Input Size: The array length can be up to $10^5$.
* Character Type: Elements are printable ASCII characters.

--- CONCEPTUAL LOGIC ---
To solve this under the $O(1)$ memory constraint, a two-pointer approach is typically used:
1. One pointer starts at the beginning of the array.
2. A second pointer starts at the end of the array.
3. The elements at these two positions are swapped.
4. The pointers then move toward the center (increment the start, decrement the end) and the process repeats until they meet.



--- COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS ---
* Time Complexity: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. Each element is visited at most once.
* Space Complexity: $O(1)$, as no additional data structures are used regardless of input size.
