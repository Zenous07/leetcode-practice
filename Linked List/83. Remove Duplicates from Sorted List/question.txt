# Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

## 🧩 Problem Overview
Given the head of a **sorted linked list**, remove all duplicate elements so that
each value appears only once.

The linked list must remain **sorted**, and the modified list should be returned.

---

## 💡 Solution: Single Pointer Traversal

### **Method Used**
Iterative Traversal with Pointer Comparison

### **Main Idea**
Because the linked list is already **sorted**, duplicate values will always appear
**next to each other**.

By traversing the list once and comparing each node with its next node,
duplicates can be detected and removed efficiently.

---

## 🛠️ Detailed Explanation
1. Start from the head of the linked list.
2. Traverse the list using a pointer (`current`).
3. For each node:
   - Compare its value with the value of the next node.
4. If both values are the same:
   - Skip the next node by updating the `next` pointer.
5. If the values are different:
   - Move the pointer forward.
6. Continue until the end of the list is reached.
7. Return the modified head of the linked list.

## 🆚 Comparison Summary

| Aspect | Extra Data Structure | In-Place Traversal |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Time Complexity | O(n) | O(n) |
| Space Complexity | O(n) | O(1) |
| Technique | Hash Set | Pointer Update |
| Performance | Good | Optimal |
| Recommended | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## 🏁 Conclusion
Since the linked list is already sorted, duplicates can be removed efficiently
using a **single traversal**.

The in-place pointer approach is optimal, requires no extra memory,
and is the preferred solution for this problem.
