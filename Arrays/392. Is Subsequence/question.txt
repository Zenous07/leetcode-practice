392. Is Subsequence

Difficulty: Easy

Problem Statement:
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (or none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde", while "aec" is not.

---

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

---

Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 10^4
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.

---

Follow-up:
Suppose there are lots of incoming strings s (s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 10^9),
and you want to check one by one whether each s is a subsequence of t.
How would you change your code in this scenario?
